# Using Gramps Web for DNA genealogy

There are three branches of DNA genealogy dependending on the type of DNA used:

- Autosomal chromosomes (numbered 1&ndash;22) are inherited from father and mother, so the probability of inheriting a piece of DNA from a given ancestor reduces exponentially with the number of generations. This makes them useful for finding degrees of separation with relatives when there is a relatively recent (few generations) common ancestor.
- The Y chromosome is only passed on from father to son, so it can be used to trace the paternal lineage.
- Mitochondrial DNA is passed on from mother to daughter, so it can be used to trace the maternal lineage.

At present, Gramps Web provides tools to work with [matches from autosomal DNA tests](dna-matches.md). To obtain this data, you need access to a DNA test that is uploaded to a matching database that allows to view DNA segment match data (e.g. MyHeritage, Gedmatch, FamilytreeDNA). Gramps Web does not perform the matching itself, as it only has access to the data you upload.
