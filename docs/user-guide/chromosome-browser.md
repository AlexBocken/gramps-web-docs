# Chromosome Browser

The chromosome browser is a tool to visualize a person's DNA matches. It shows the DNA segments shared with other people in the tree as colored bars on the chromosomes.

You can find it under the &ldquo;Chromosome Browser&rdquo; tab in the DNA view.

For each chromosome, the upper (light blue) bar represents the copy inherited from the father, the lower (light red) bar the one inherited from the mother. The shared segments are shown as colored bars on top of these. If the side (paternal or maternal) is not known, the segment spans both bars and is shown with hatch marks.

Clicking on the name of a match in the legend, only this person's shared segments are shown.
