# Gramps Web frontend development

The Gramps Web frontend is called [Gramps.js](https://github.com/gramps-project/Gramps.js).
It is written in Javascript and built using web components with [Lit](https://lit.dev/). This allows encapsulating functionality into reusable components.

The frontend is designed as a progressive single-page web app with a mobile-first experience. It makes heavy use of [Material Web Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-web) for a Material Design look and feel.
